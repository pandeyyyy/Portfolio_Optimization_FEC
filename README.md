# Portfolio_Optimization_FEC
# Portfolio Optimization with Python

This Python project implements portfolio optimization techniques to construct efficient investment portfolios. It utilizes modern portfolio theory (MPT) principles to allocate assets effectively, aiming to maximize returns while minimizing risk.

## Features:
- **Asset Selection**: The project includes modules for selecting a diverse set of assets from various asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities.

- **Risk Assessment**: Calculated covariance and correlation matrices to assess the risk characteristics of each asset in the portfolio. Calculated the Sharpe ratio to evaluate risk-adjusted returns.

- **Optimization Techniques**: Utilized the Markowitz model to optimize the portfolio for the highest Sharpe ratio, balancing risk and return.

- **Efficient Frontier**: Explored the efficient frontier, a set of optimal portfolios that offers the highest expected return for a given level of risk, or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.
